# Project Tasks

## Constructing Boolean Expression
- **Tools Used:** Text editor
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Logic, Boolean algebra
- **Description:**
  - Manually construct a Boolean expression (φH) in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for a given graph (graph H) as described in Problem 1.
  - Represent the logical operations using text representations (~ for ¬, & for ∧, | for ∨).
  - Save the expression in a one-line text file named "prob1.txt."

## Writing AWK Script
- **Tools Used:** Text editor
- **Skills Demonstrated:** AWK scripting, regular expressions, file input/output
- **Description:**
  - Write an AWK script (prob2.awk) that takes a graph represented in the specified format as input and produces a one-line text file containing the text representation of a Boolean expression (φG) in CNF.
  - The script should handle the conversion of logical operations as described in Task 3.
  - Save the AWK script in a file named "prob2.awk."

## Counting Clauses
- **Tools Used:** None
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Mathematical reasoning, problem-solving
- **Description:**
  - Provide an expression for the number of clauses in φG in terms of n (number of vertices) and m (number of edges).
  - The expression should be justified.
  - Save your explanation in a PDF file named "prob3.pdf."

## Modifying AWK Script
- **Tools Used:** Text editor
- **Skills Demonstrated:** AWK scripting, text manipulation
- **Description:**
  - Copy the AWK script from Problem 2 and modify it to generate a one-line command that can be executed in SageMath to test the satisfiability of φG.
  - The output of the script should include the necessary SageMath command.
  - Save the modified AWK script in a file named "prob4.awk."

## Testing Problem 4
- **Tools Used:** Linux Command Line, SageMath
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Using command-line tools, testing and validation
- **Description:**
  - Test the modified AWK script (prob4.awk) on several different graphs (using the input file) to generate SageMath commands for each graph.
  - Execute the SageMath commands to determine if φG is satisfiable and validate the results.
